C# Design Patterns
design pattern its way to slove problems in out code and build a good architecture for our program.

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. This means that the behavior of the subclass should be consistent with the superclass.



 Adapter Pattern
The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

 Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It's useful when you want to restrict instantiation of a class to a single object.

 Strategy Pattern
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

 State Pattern
The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates states into separate classes and delegates the behavior to these classes based on the current state of the object.
